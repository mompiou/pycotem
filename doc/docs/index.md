#pycotem

pycotem is a python package for working with crystal orientations in transmission electron microscopy. It provides 6 GUI tools to:

- determine orientation from diffraction patterns: [diffraction](diffraction.md)

- determine orientation from Kikuchi patterns: [kikuchi](kikuchi.md)

- work with stereographic projections: [stereoproj](stereoproj.md)

- determine interface normal and direction from images: [interface](interface.md)

- determine orientation relationship and misorientation between two crystals: [misorientation](misorientation.md)

- display crystal projection on a plane and draw dichromatic patterns: [crystal](crystal.md)
