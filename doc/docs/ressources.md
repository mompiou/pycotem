## Running tests

Images and diffraction patterns are available [here](https://github.com/mompiou/pycotem/tree/master/test).

Information are given in the ```test.txt``` file. Kikuchi pattern, diffraction patterns and a series of bright field images can be used to test [kikuchi](kikuchi.md), [diffraction](diffraction.md) and [interface](interface.md).
