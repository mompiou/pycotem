pycotem is a python package for working with crystal orientations in transmission electron microscopy. It provides 6 GUI tools to:

- determine orientation from diffraction patterns: ```diffraction```

- determine orientation from Kikuchi patterns: ```kikuchi```

- work with stereographic projections: ```stereoproj```

- determine interface normal and direction from images: ```interface```

- determine orientation relationship and misorientation between two crystals: ```misorientation```

- display crystal projection on a plane and draw dichromatic patterns: ```crystal```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

pycotem relies on ```python3``` with ```numpy```, ```pillow```, ```matplotlib```  and ```pyqt5``` (for GUI) packages.

### Installing and running

pycotem can be installed with pip: ```pip3 install pycotem```
Run ```python3 -m pycotem.xxxx``` for the different tools: ```stereoproj```, ```diffraction```, ```kikuchi```,```misorientation```,```interface``` and ```crystal```.

### Examples

Image files and setting parameters are provided in the ```test``` directory in the github repository for testing ```diffraction```, ```interface``` and ```kikuchi```.
